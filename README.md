### Oancea Ionut Eugen
| Task| Description | Completition |
| - | - | - |
| Create movement Script | Create a script that would allow the player to move smoothly on the map using keyboard inputs. Ive added animations, sound & particles, interconected. | 80% - Player hits platforms from below |
| Basic rilemap | Create a tilemap, and a default map for the player to play on. I used the sunny valley free assets, along with a script that allows me to automatically generate terrain | 100% |
| 3D model of the cat | Create a 3d model of our hero character in C4D |  50% The model has too many poligons & can't be rigged |

The current game greets you with a fx character, that can jump, run, move, dash & crouch with particle effects & sounds.
The camera shakes on impact & the player jump is influenced by the ammount of time the player keeps the spacebar pressed, by the previous state of the player (for example if the player is crouching, before jumping, it will jump higher )
