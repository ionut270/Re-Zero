# Weekly summary

## Week 1
### Oancea Ionut Eugen
| Task| Description | Completition |
| - | - | - |
| Create movement Script | Create a script that would allow the player to move smoothly on the map using keyboard inputs. Ive added animations, sound & particles, interconected. | 80% - Player hits platforms from below |
| Basic rilemap | Create a tilemap, and a default map for the player to play on. I used the sunny valley free assets, along with a script that allows me to automatically generate terrain | 100% |
| 3D model of the cat | Create a 3d model of our hero character in C4D |  50% The model has too many poligons & can't be rigged |

The current game greets you with a fx character, that can jump, run, move, dash & crouch with particle effects & sounds.
The camera shakes on impact & the player jump is influenced by the ammount of time the player keeps the spacebar pressed, by the previous state of the player (for example if the player is crouching, before jumping, it will jump higher )

|      ToDo          |Description                         |Progress                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Minimal UI |I created 5 scenes: Start,Story,Lvl 1,Replay and End. I have implemented the transition between scenes using SceneManager. Methods are called by buttons such as Start New Game, Skip, Continue, Replay, Exit. Note: The Replay class retains the index of the scene from which it was called.            |80%           |
|Player Class         |In the player class I created the methods for heal and damage received and I added in the Die method (if the player is dead) a transition to the Replay scene.            |70%            |
|Enemy Class          |The first enemy is a frog that jumps continuously (just jumping on the spot with a delay of 4 seconds). It has implemented several triggers for collision with the playing field and the player. In frontal collision with the player will give 10 damage. |50%|
|HealthBar| I have implemented the 2 methods for HealthBar: SetMaxHealth and SetHealth which set the maximum and starting value of the slider and the current value that will change during the game.| 100%|
